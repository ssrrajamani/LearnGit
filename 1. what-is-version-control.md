## Version Control
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

## Version Control System
Software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of **database**.

## Why Version Control/Version Control softwares are needed?

1. For almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected. 
2. The source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort.

    *Version control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.*

## What Version Control offers?

Software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code. 

One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code, each developer may make their changes in several parts of the project code base.

With Version Control:

- Track every individual change by each contributor
- Prevent concurrent work from conflicting
- Facilitate a smooth and continuous flow of changes to the code rather than the frustrating file locking

Without Version Control:

- Not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users
- Versioning files using suffixes like "final" or "latest"
- Commenting out code blocks to disable certain functionality but without removing code

## Benefits of Version Control?

- A complete **long-term change history** of every file over the years. (File creatation, deletion, edits, renaming, moving). This history should also include the author, date and written notes on the purpose of each change.
- **Branching and merging**. Creating a "branch" in VCS tools keeps multiple streams of work independent from each other while also providing the facility to merge that work back together, enabling developers to verify that the changes on each branch do not conflict. 
- **Traceability**. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such as Jira, and being able to annotate each change with a message describing the purpose and intent of the change can help not only with root cause analysis and other forensics.
