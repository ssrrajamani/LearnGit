## Save a file

### git add and git commit

Before jumping into `git add` and `git commit`, it is important to understand how git internally saves(commit) the files.

Saving a file in a version control system like git is not something like saving a file in a word document using `ctrl+s`

Git uses three stages to save a file

1. Working directory
2. Staging area
3. Commit history

`git add` takes the changes done in working directory into staging area

Staging area is used to group the relevant changes done in working directory which can then be commited(saved) as a single commit

For ex: Let's say you have modified three files file1, file2 and file3. Now you want to save the changes done in file1 and file2 in a single commit

You can do `git add file1` and `git add file2` which groups both the file changes into the staging area

Moving changes into staging area can be done in various ways and in various levels

1. `git add <file>` used to convert untracked file into tracked file and if tracked, stage all the changes in that file

        mkdir repo1
        cd repo1 
        git init
        echo "line1" >> file1.txt   //new untracked file
        git status
        git add file1.txt

        echo "line2" >> file1.txt   // tracked file
        git status
        git add file1.txt
        
2. `git add <directory>` used to convert untracked folder into tracked folder and if tracked, stage all the changes in that folder

3. `git add -p` Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit. This will present you with a chunk of changes and prompt you for a command. Use y to stage the chunk, n to ignore the chunk, s to split it into smaller chunks, e to manually edit the chunk, and q to exit.

    Ex: If file1 has changes in line 1 and line 2 and we want to stage only line 1 change, `git add -p file1` allows us to stage only line 1 change. 
4. `git add .` stage all the changes made in the working directory (changes made to tracked file/folder and add untracked new file/ folder to tracked list)

`git commit` saves the changes of files in staging area to a commit

Commit creates a checkpoint of all the changes present in staging area into a single commit.

Git’s version control model is based on snapshots. For example, a SVN commit consists of a diff compared to the original file added to the repository. Git, on the other hand, records the entire contents of each file in every commit.

Commit is done to the local repository, and this requires absolutely no interaction with other Git repositories. Git commits can later be pushed to arbitrary remote repositories.

1. `git commit` - Commit the staged snapshot. This will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message. After you’ve entered a message, save the file and close the editor to create the actual commit.
2. `git commit -a` - Shortcut to commit tracked file changes without doing git add.

3. `git commit -m "commit message" / git commit -am "commit message"` - provide a commit message directly

4. `git commit --amend` - This is helpful when we missed to add file changes to the commit and want it to be commited as part of last commit.
Instead of creating a new commit, staged changes will be added to the previous commit. And also allows us to edit last commit message.

## Undo save

`git restore <file>` To undo unstaged changes made in the file

    >> cat file1.txt
    line 1
    line 2
    >> echo "line 3" >> file1.txt
    >> git restore file1.txt
    >> cat file1.txt
    line 1
    line 2

`git restore --staged <file>` To undo staged changes made in the file

    >> echo "line 3" >> file1.txt
    >> git add file1.txt
    >> git restore --staged file1.txt
    >> cat file1.txt
    line 1
    line 2

> **Curious :** Let's take you have both staged and unstaged changes made to file. And you restore only staged changes. What happens now?
