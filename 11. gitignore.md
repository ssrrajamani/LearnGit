## gitignore

By default, git tracks all the files and folders.
.gitignore file helps us to mention the files and folders we don't git to track.

Usually .gitignore file is present in the root directory of the repository

    sample
    -- .gitignore
    -- src
        -- java
    -- config.json

.gitignore uses globbing patterns to match against file names. You can construct your patterns using various symbols present [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)

1.**Shared gitignore** files in the repository can exist in the respective directories but a conventional practice is having a single .gitignore in the root of the repository.

2.**Personal gitignore** We can also define personal gitignore patterns for the repository which need not be pushed to others **(.git/info/exclude)**

3.**Global gitignore** In addition, you can define global Git ignore patterns for all repositories on your local system by setting the Git core.excludesFile property. You'll have to create this file yourself. If you're unsure where to put your global .gitignore file, your home directory isn't a bad choice (and makes it easy to find later). Once you've created the file, you'll need to configure its location with git config:    
    
    >> touch ~/.gitignore
    >> git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore

4.**Ignore previously committed file**
If you want to ignore a file that you've committed in the past, you'll need to delete the file from your repository and then add a .gitignore rule for it. Using the --cached option with git rm means that the file will be deleted from your repository, but will remain in your working directory as an ignored file.

    >> echo debug.log >> .gitignore
  
    >> git rm --cached debug.log
    rm 'debug.log'
  
    >> git commit -m "Start ignoring debug.log"

5.**Debug gitignore files/folders**
If you have complicated .gitignore patterns, or patterns spread over multiple .gitignore files, it can be difficult to track down why a particular file is being ignored. You can use the git check-ignore command with the -v (or --verbose) option to determine which pattern is causing a particular file to be ignored:

    >> git check-ignore -v debug.log
    .gitignore:3:*.log  debug.log
