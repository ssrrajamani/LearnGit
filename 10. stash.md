## Stash

git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.

`git stash` The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy. 

Note that the stash is local to your Git repository; stashes are not transferred to the server when you push.

    
    $ git status
    On branch main
    Changes to be committed:

        new file:   style.css

    Changes not staged for commit:

        modified:   index.html

    $ git stash
    
    Saved working directory and index state WIP on
    main: 5002d47 our new homepage
    HEAD is now at 5002d47 our new homepage

    $ git status
    On branch main
    nothing to commit, working tree clean

`git stash pop/apply`

You can reapply previously stashed changes with git stash pop/apply:

    $ git status
    On branch main
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    
    $ git stash pop
    On branch main
    Changes to be committed:

        new file:   style.css

    Changes not staged for commit:

        modified:   index.html

    Dropped refs/stash@{0} (32b3aa1d185dfe6d57b3c3cc3b32cbf3e380cc6a)

Popping your stash removes the changes from your stash and reapplies them to your working copy.

Alternatively, you can reapply the changes to your working copy and keep them in your stash with `git stash apply`

This is useful if you want to apply the same stashed changes to multiple branches.

>There is one caveat with git stash you need to be aware of: by default Git won't stash changes made to untracked or ignored files.

`git stash -u/--include-untracked` 

By default, running git stash will stash:

- changes that have been added to your index (staged changes)
- changes made to files that are currently tracked by Git (unstaged changes)

But it will not stash:

- new files in your working copy that have not yet been staged
- files that have been ignored

So if we add a third file to our example above, but don't stage it (i.e. we don't run git add), git stash won't stash it.

    $ script.js

    $ git status
    On branch main
    Changes to be committed:

        new file:   style.css

    Changes not staged for commit:

        modified:   index.html

    Untracked files:

        script.js

    $ git stash
    Saved working directory and index state WIP on main:    5002d47 our new homepage
    HEAD is now at 5002d47 our new homepage

    $ git status
    On branch main
    Untracked files:

        script.js

Adding the -u option (or --include-untracked) tells git stash to also stash your untracked files:

    $ git status
    On branch main
    Changes to be committed:

        new file:   style.css

    Changes not staged for commit:

        modified:   index.html

    Untracked files:

        script.js

    $ git stash -u
    Saved working directory and index state WIP on main:    5002d47 our new homepage
    HEAD is now at 5002d47 our new homepage

    $ git status
    On branch main
    nothing to commit, working tree clean

`git stash -a` You can include changes to ignored files as well by passing the -a option (or --all) when running git stash.

`git stash --keep-index` stash the changes in staged area but don't remove it from current session

`git stash list` lists all the stashes 

    $ git stash list
    stash@{0}: WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage
    stash@{1}: WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage
    stash@{2}: WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage

Here,

`stash@{0}` identifier  
`WIP` Work in Progress  
`main` Branch in which stash is done    
`5002d47` Commit on top of which stash is done      
`our new homepage` Commit message of commit 5002d47

To provide a bit more context, it's good practice to annotate your stashes with a description, using git stash save "message":

    $ git stash save "add style to our site"
    Saved working directory and index state On main: add style to our site
    HEAD is now at 5002d47 our new homepage

    $ git stash list
    stash@{0}: On main: add style to our site
    stash@{1}: WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage
    stash@{2}: WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage

By default, git stash pop will re-apply the most recently created stash: stash@{0}

You can choose which stash to re-apply by passing its identifier as the last argument, for example:

    $ git stash pop stash@{2}


`git stash show` view a summary of a last stash

`git stash show <identifier>` view a summary of a particular stash


    $ git stash show
    file1.txt | 1 +
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    

Or pass the -p option (or --patch) to view the full diff of a stash:

    diff --git a/file1.txt b/file1.txt
    index c0d0fb4..83db48f 100644
    --- a/file1.txt
    +++ b/file1.txt
    @@ -1,2 +1,3 @@
     line1
     line2
    +line3

`git stash -p` You can also choose to stash just a single file, a collection of files, or individual changes from within files. If you pass the -p option (or --patch) to git stash, it will iterate through each changed "hunk" in your working copy and ask whether you wish to stash it

`git stash branch <branch_name> <stash_identifier>` Creates a new branch having the stash appplied on top of the commit on which the stash was done
