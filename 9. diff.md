## Diff

Diffing is a function that takes two input data sets and outputs the changes between them. It can compare multiple data sources. These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more.

`git diff` Show you any unstaged changes

        echo "line2" >> file1.txt
        git diff

Output

        diff --git a/file1.txt b/file1.txt
        index a29bdeb..c0d0fb4 100644
        --- a/file1.txt
        +++ b/file1.txt
        @@ -1 +1,2 @@
        line1
        +line2

`git diff --cached` Show you the staged changes


        echo "line2" >> file1.txt
        git add file1.txt
        git diff --cached

Output

        diff --git a/file1.txt b/file1.txt
        index a29bdeb..c0d0fb4 100644
        --- a/file1.txt
        +++ b/file1.txt

To check the diff of a specific file `git diff <file>` and `git diff --cached <file>`


`git diff <commit_id1> <commit_id2>` As commits are checkpoints, we can check the changes between two commits. Commit ID can be retrieved from `git log`

        echo "line1" >> file2.txt
        git add file2.txt
        git commit -m "add file2"

        echo "line2" >> file2.txt
        git add file2.txt
        git commit -m "update file2"
        git log --pretty=oneline        
        git diff d3738a8069c74a9b7eb84415121c927ee4c968e1 03d6d5e055777d14f1368f688e733ee65fbee79b

`git diff <branch1>..<branch2>` compare the changes between two branches. 

>**Q**: Now branches have series of commits which commit will be taken to be compared.    
**Ans**: Two dot operator takes the tip of the branches to compare.    
                                
        Let's say we have,  
        branch1: A -> B -> C    
        branch2: D -> E -> F  

        >git diff branch1..branch2
        It takes C and F commits to be compared


`git diff <branch1>...<branch2>` compare the changes made in feature_branch with the common ancestor of the branches.

        Let's say we have,

        branch1:        D -> E -> F
                        |
        feature_branch: A -> B -> C -> G

        >git diff branch1...feature_branch
        It compares commit G in feature_branch with commit A in feature_branch (common ancestor between branch1 and feature_branch)

This helps us see the progress we have made in feature_branch from the time we have created branch1 from feature_branch.

`git diff branch1 feature_branch ./diff_test.txt`
compare a specific file across branches, pass in the path of the file as the third argument to git diff
