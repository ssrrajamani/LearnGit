## Cloning up a repository

### git clone

1.`git clone https://github.com/ssrrajamani/LearnGit.git`

Initializes a new Git repository in the **LearnGit** folder on your local machine and populates it with the contents of the central repository. 

2.`git clone <repo> <directory>` 

Clone the repository located at ＜repo＞ into the folder called ~＜directory＞! on the local machine.

3.`git clone --branch <tag>/<branch> <repo>`

Clone a specific tag/branch of the repo

> Tag is a pointer to a commit. When you want to develop on top of the commit the tag points to, we can create a new branch using `git switch -c <branch_name>`. If any commits are created on top of the tag it will be moved to the new branch


4.`git clone -depth=1 <repo>`

Clone the repository located at ＜repo＞ and only clone the  history of commits specified by the option depth=1. In this example a clone of ＜repo＞ is made and only the most recent commit is included in the new cloned Repo. Shallow cloning is most useful when working with repos that have an extensive commit history. An extensive commit history may cause scaling problems such as disk space usage limits and long wait times when cloning. A Shallow clone can help alleviate these scaling issues.
